# The tube for you and me
I could make bold comparison about the library of alexandria and how YouTube is the modern re-incarnation, or at least a top contender.  I could reference the cellphone videos that are now living documents of injustice, police brutality, and human rights violations. But for me the preservation of YouTube is all about the simple videos.  A "My Dad Reacts to ______" or a "Cooking Traditional Food with Grandma".  Or the High School project that got uploaded and went viral one time, one week, three years ago.

For the first time in history the poor, the disenfranchised, the normal, the regular, people like you: the reader, can document our lives. And you can present your life how you want.  You can be honest!  You can show us the real low lows.  You can paint a rosy picture, maybe a picture that not even you or your family would really believe.  But you get to do it your way with your point of view.

Most of history is all about the elite.  The upper class. The pharoahs, kings, queens, warlords.  No one gave a shit about what the peasants were doing on the bank of the Nile.  No one bothered to write down what holidays they celebrated, how they lived day-to-day, who took care of the kids while they had to work.  My god they barely make it into the heiroglyphs.  Just a bunch of nameless dirt pounders farming wheat or building pyramids. 

This continues on through most of human history.  When we learn about the Medieval Times in our Euro-centric classes its all about how the land was owned by the nearest rich douche.  And the wealthiest douche ruled the largest piece of land because a lady in a lake gave him a sword.  Did the locals think this was a poor system?  I dunno because I couldn't subscribe to their vlog.

You can pick a culture and a point on the timeline for our species, you'd probably find something to get curious about.  My point is simple: we've finally got a record of what's going on the world.  A fairly accurate one!  Imagine if the history after 2001 September, 11th was only recorded as it related to Presidents and world leaders.  All record of public opinion discarded.  No record of the backlash of invading soveriegn nations followed by the subsequent indifference of the world.

The world would look fairly grim without the rythm of daily life. People care of course, about the world stage, but day-to-day life dominates.  Christmas parties, suprise gifts, funny things their dog did.  I doubt our ancestors were any different.  Survining as well as they could while surrouned by bullshit.

At the bare minimum, the contents of YouTube should be preserved, like a queryable time capsule. This content is like an old film camera thats been started by a greedy filmmaker.  What happens if they get sick of maintaining that film?  Who has the right to keep it and store it for the poor dirt farmers of the future?  Its my belief that everyone has a right to it.  Every government that is able should be preserving and archiving these moments.

This is not to disparage or put down the private groups who are undertaking this exact thing.  I think their efforts should be backed by public funds as it is a worthy endeavour.
