# Wow its been a while?  How does Hugo work again?

## Start a new post 
Or whatever the equivalent to `posts` are for you:
`hugo new posts/blog-entry-title.md`

This should create a new markdown file with the title you just specified under `../site-parent-dir/content/posts/blog-entry-title.md`.


## Check it out locally via a localhost server
`hugo server -D`
Need -D to show the drafts.
